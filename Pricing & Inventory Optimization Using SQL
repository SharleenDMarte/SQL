-- 1. Most expensive items
--High priced items generate higher margins but require careful inventory management due to lower stock levels.

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc
LIMIT 5
;

-- 2. Show the items ordered from lowest to highest stock
--Items with low stock levels show potential stockout risk and may require restocking to meet customer demand.

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
ORDER BY stock_quantity
;

-- 3. Show the average price of all items
--The average item price provides a benchmark for evaluating whether individual products are priced above or below the overall store norm.

SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM superstore
;

-- 4. Show the average price for items in the category of Kitchen Supplies
--Kitchen Supplies are generally priced at a moderate level, suggesting they are positioned as accessible, high-volume products within the store.

SELECT category, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

-- 5. Show the total stock quantity for items in the Electronics category
--Electronics maintain a limited overall stock level, indicating higher-value items that may require tighter inventory control to avoid lost sales.

SELECT category, SUM(stock_quantity) AS total_stock
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY category;

--6. What are the top rated products with low stock?
--Highly rated products with low stock represent high-priority restocking opportunities, as demand is likely strong and customer satisfaction is already proven.

SELECT item_name, average_rating, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.6
ORDER BY stock_quantity ASC;

--7. What is the revenue potential for products in stock?
--Categories with the highest potential revenue contribute most to overall sales and should be prioritized for inventory and marketing investment.

SELECT category, SUM(price * stock_quantity) AS potential_revenue
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY potential_revenue DESC;


--Key Takeaways
--1. High priced products such as electronics and furnishings offer strong revenue potential but require careful inventory management due to lower stock levels.
--2. Low stock items present potential stockout risks, particularly for popular and high value products, indicating a need for proactive restocking.
--3. Kitchen Supplies are moderately priced and consistently stocked, positioning them as reliable, high volume products that support steady sales.
--4. Top-rated products with limited inventory represent high-priority opportunities for restocking, as customer demand and satisfaction are already established.
--5. Electronics generate the highest potential revenue, making them a critical category for inventory planning and strategic investment.
--6. Category level analysis highlights where inventory resources and pricing strategies can be optimized to maximize overall business performance.
